# SVG-logo-maker

## About this Project
The main objective for this project was to make an applicaton that generates an SVG image file using user input. To invoke this application, the user would open the command line inside the project and type 'node index.js'. The user is then met with four questions about what preferences they would like for their logo. Using the user's answers, the application creates a simple SVG image titled 'logo.svg' that can be viewed and downloaded!
